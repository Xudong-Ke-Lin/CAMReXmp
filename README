CAMFPAMReX: This software contains a CAMbridge Multi-Fluid Plasma code.

It is a C++ AMReX-based code designed to run in parallel using
MPI/OMP. Additionally, it can also be run using GPUs.

It uses source code from the amrex/Src/Base, Boundary, AmrCore, and
Amr directories.

The directory Exec/ includes a makefile and Exect/test/ includes a sample inputs file.
Plotfiles are generated that can be viewed with amrvis2d / amrvis3d
(CCSE's native vis / spreadsheet tool, downloadable separately from ccse.lbl.gov)
or with VisIt.

Source code
Fluid model:
-Define variables
-Calculate speed of sound (and other speeds), flux function
-Also contain specific solvers, HLLC, exact, etc.
-Also linked to InitData to set up particular components

InitData:
-Define initial data depending on the test. Linked to model for specific comp.
-Set up boundary conditions

Methods:
-Flux method: Riemann based->model, centred scheme: defined globally
-Source treatments
-Reconstructions: MUSCL, WENO
-RK methods

Field solver
-Div Free update (and reconstruction?)

Build Requirements
==================

Dimension:

  The Advection_AmrLevel tests only compile in 2 or 3 dimensions. Therefore
  when configuring CMake to build the test it maybe necessary to add the
  flag -DAMReX_SPACEDIM=2 or -DAMReX_SPACEDIM=3 (Enabled by default). If one
  sets -DAMReX_SPACEDIM=1, no executable will be created.

System:

  The Advection_AmrLevel tests are not supported on Windows systems.
